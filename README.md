## Dotfiles

Run `sh ~/dotfiles/make.sh' to create a new dotfiles directory and symlink appropriate files. Then,
on first Vim startup, run `:BundleInstall`. Restart Vim and you are good to go.

* All dotfiles symlinked from `~/`
* Private and box specific bash settings held in `~/.bashrc-local`
* Backup of preferences held in `~/prefs/` and on Github [repo](https://github.com/cdmedia/prefs)
